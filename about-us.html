   					At Dimension, we aim to create devices which can allow for a simulated reality experience, which are affordable and can be enjoyed by ordinary people across the globe. Our aim is to create a reality so immersive that on entering, you will never want to leave.

					We want it to be your world, where you can lead the life of your choice, where there are no limits to whom you can be. This goal is reflected in our motto, <q>Verus Nullus. Omnis Licitus</q>, which translates to "Nothing is true, everything is permitted". This is the ideal state which we aim to achieve.

					The potential applications of simulated reality are innumerable. Imagine being in school without even moving from your bed. Imagine playing your favourite game, except that you yourself are a character in the game. Imagine painting and creating 3D artworks in a spherical canvas all around you. Imagine watching a football match live at the stadium from the comfort of your sofa.
